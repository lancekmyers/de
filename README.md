## A simple Differential Equation library

The [diffrax](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/) library by Patrick Kidger is excellent, both because it includes plenty of high quality integrators and it has a very well designed API. 
This is mostly a translation right now, hopefully I can transition it to something more idiomatic over time.
